This FastAPI code creates an API that helps us work with posts and comments from a sample data source. It has several endpoints to get data:

Get All Posts: The /posts/ endpoint fetches all posts or a specific post if you provide a postId.

Get All Comments: The /comments/ endpoint does the same for comments, either getting all comments or just those for a specific post.

User-Specific Posts: The /formatted_posts/{userID} endpoint gets all posts by a specific user and formats the data nicely.

Comments for a Specific Post: The /formatted_comment/{postID} endpoint gets comments for a specific post and formats them.

Detailed User Posts: The new /detailed_post/{userID} endpoint combines everything. It fetches all posts for a user and includes all comments for each of those posts in the response.

The code uses the requests library to fetch data from a placeholder API and formats it using Python dictionaries. This way, you get a clear view of what each user has posted and what comments those posts received.

Overall, it's a handy way to explore and organize posts and comments based on users!
